Did you know Toronto is one of the safest cities across the globe? The Safe Cities Index published by The Economist ranks Toronto as the second safest urban city in 2021! (The Economist, Safe cities index 2019) With that being said, Toronto does experience different levels of crime: even bicycle theft. Cycling is a rapidly growing transportation mode in the city, promoting physical activity, cleaner environments and eased vehicle congestion. However, the appeal is ruined if you worry about your bike getting stolen. For the cyclist community, we want to inform them of how safe the city is when it comes to their bikes.

From our study, the City of Toronto and their police divisions stand to learn where their attention should be focused to improve bicycle safety in its 140 neighbourhoods.

Our article aims to explore bicycle thefts in depth, making it relevant to the audiences of the public and government. And it is all centered around the data of over 21,000 bicycle thefts provided by the City of Toronto within the span of 2014 to 2019.

At the end of this article you should be able to answer these two questions.
1. Where should you be parking their bike? How cautious should you be?
2. Where is bike theft really happening? Where should we enforce more safety measures?
